# F2020-SDSProject

Submit a single .pdf file: 1-page (max) project prospectus outlining the question, proposed methods, and data sources you hope to pursue for your project. The prospectus is ungraded, but it is an opportunity for you to get feedback on your idea and approach.  
 
The structure of the final project (not of the prospectus) should be the following (5 pages max, including all relevant figures):
•	Introduction: describe the data that you chose and the goals (scientific questions) that you want answer with your analysis
•	Methods: describe which method you use to accomplish your goals, including potential preprocessing steps, choice of method and choice of parameters. You can either use a single model (justify your model choice) or compare the performance of different models to reach your conclusions
•	Results: show the results (include tables, graphs) that support your goal
 
Grading rubric for the final project:
•	(5pt) clarity of the exposition (how clearly the analysis is explained)
•	(5pt) correctness of the approach (does the analysis meets the goals that you had?)
•	(3pt) justification of the approach (for example, why do you choose a Lasso with λ=0.4λ=0.4, or a clustering method with 4 groups?)
•	(5pt) correctness of the code (does the code produce the correct results?)
•	(2pt) legibility of the code (remove redundant code, write code legibly)
